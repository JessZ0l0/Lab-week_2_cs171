    <h2>My muses are food and travel</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ice cream is pure, frozen happiness in a scoop</li>
        <li>Spicy food: the delicious fire that makes my taste buds question my life choices.</li>
        <li>Travel is my passport to adventure, even if it means my boyfriend's stomach has a different itinerary.</li>

    <h2>In all seriousness though a little...or a lot about me!</h2>
    <p class="about-paragraph">
       I absolutely adore a few simple pleasures in life. First and foremost, there's nothing quite like indulging in a scoop of rich, creamy ice cream, especially on a warm summer day. I also have a deep appreciation for the fiery delight of spicy food, the kind that makes your taste buds dance with excitement. When it comes to leisure, I'm passionate about exploring new and captivating destinations, always seeking the thrill of adventure in new places. Nature has a special place in my heart, and I relish the serenity of hiking and spending time outdoors, breathing in the fresh air and taking in the beauty of the natural world. Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting the enchanting island of Madeira in Portugal, an experience that left me in awe of its breathtaking landscapes. On a creative note, I've embarked on a pottery journey, finding joy and inspiration in shaping clay into art. Life's an adventure, and I'm savoring every moment of it!
